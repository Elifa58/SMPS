# SMPS
I designed a PCB that is 85-265VAC to 12VDC, 1A SPMS for my graduate project. In this design I used UC3845 ic for control and feedback, EMI filter for common mode and differential mode noise. I made calculations and designed a transformer by using hand. Also I simulated the operation of the circuit in LTSpice.
